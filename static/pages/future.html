			<p>Future work for this project will be on the recommendation aspects, i.e., identifying good sports ambassadors or regions specific sporting events. India, for example is already showing a high positive sentiment towards female athletes and further analysis can show which athlete. My system ideally would be able to show country-by-country the athletes which are associated with postive sentiments. Also data extracted from public profiles of the 20 athletes about their followers, will help in the building of a robust recommendation system. This project has the scope, and requires additional work. Handling of errors, outliers and trends will also be focused upon to provide unique insights into the data. </p>
